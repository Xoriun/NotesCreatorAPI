# NotesCreatorAPI
A component for LiveSplit that connects to my notes creator tool NotesCreator (https://github.com/Xoriun/Notes-Creator).

## Set-up
Download the newest NotesCreatorAPI.dll into the Components folder of LiveSplit.
To use, open the edit menu of the LiveSplit layout you want to use together with NotesCreator and add Other -> LiveSplitAPI.
